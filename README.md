# EDA with Python

This repository contains comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed using Python on multiple real-world datasets. The goal is to uncover patterns, detect outliers, test hypotheses, and summarize the key characteristics of each dataset with both visual and statistical methods.

## Datasets Covered

1. *Deliveries Dataset*  
   - contains the match descriptions, results, winners, player of the matches, ball by ball dataset and much more.

2. *Diabetes Dataset*  
   - Medical data exploration to uncover relationships between features and diabetes status.

3. *Global Cybersecurity Threats Dataset*  
   - EDA of international cybersecurity incidents, frequency, types, and regional insights.

4. *Nutrition Dataset*  
   - Nutritional profiling and comparison of food items and nutrients.

## Key Python Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pandas_profiling or ydata-profiling

## Structure

Each dataset is explored in a separate Jupyter Notebook. Typical analysis includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistics
- Missing value treatment
- Correlation analysis
- Visualizations (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, scatterplots, etc.)
- Insights and summary
